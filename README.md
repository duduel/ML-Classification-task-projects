# ML Classification task projects

## • Adaboost:
Machine Learning model that predicts the success of Coups d’etat attempts accross the world. We achieved model performance of 76% test
accuracy on feature-engineered data (only political variables) in Python using Adaboost based on feature selection from LASSO
regularization and feature importance using a RandomForest classifier.

## • CNNs:
Machine Learning model with 86% validation accuracy and 76% test accuracy in Python using Conv Neural Networks, Vision Transformers
(ConvNeXtTiny), and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models (VGG19, etc.) for a music genre classification task using
augmented data of image representations of audio (Mel Spectrograms) as input.
